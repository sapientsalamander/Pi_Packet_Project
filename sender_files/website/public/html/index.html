                        <p>What the heck is this thing? The damn best web interface for packet generation you have ever laid your eyes on!</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this project was to provide a simple, but also customizable packet generator. This web interface was a step towards that "simple" goal. It's been designed to be much easier to work with than the built-in interface that was integrated with the Pi.</p>

These are organized into different pages, as you can see from the tab. So, you can theoretically visit them in any order you want, although it's encouraged to go in order.</div>
