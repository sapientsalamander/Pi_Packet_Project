# Pi Packet Project

This project focuses on the basics of networking. Two Raspberry Pi's will form a communication network where one will act as a sender and the other as a receiver. The sender will then attempt to form packets that can be preconfigured by the user and send them to the receiver. They will then display any diagnostic information that they have available on LCD shields that they are connected to.
